## 🌱 What’s this all about?

**Rise from Rejection: Hall of Fame** is a small tribute to the greats who got turned down, laughed at, ignored—and still made it.

It’s a collection of stories about people who got told _“no”_, and turned it into _“watch me.”_ From tech legends to artists, CEOs to scientists—it’s proof that rejection isn’t the end. Sometimes, it’s the start. (_Elon is my favorite btw_)

## 🖤 Why this project?

Because **_not_** enough people talk about the nos behind the **_yeses_**.
Because we all need a reminder that rejection isn’t the end.

This isn’t just a site. It’s a statement.
